Today set up GitHub Pages to my GitHub profile following [Creating a GitHub Pages site with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll). This might be the place where I will write my posts from now on and probably I will move my old posts from Wordpress here.

In short, the basic steps to set up GitHub Pages to your GitHub profile are:

1. Create a new repository with the name `username.github.io` where `username` is your GitHub username.
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
1. Install and set up Jekyll

To change the site settings and theme, edit the `_config.yml` file and push the changes to the repository. 

To add a new post, create a new file in the `_posts` directory with the name `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md` and include the necessary front matter.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight go %}
func IntToSliceOfBits(i, length int) []int {
	bits := make([]int, length)
	for j := 0; j < length; j++ {
		bits[j] = (i >> uint(j)) & 1
	}
	return bits
}
{% endhighlight %}

However they don't seem any different from the standard markdown code blocks:

```go
func IntToArrayOfBits(i, length int) []int {
	bits := make([]int, length)
	for j := 0; j < length; j++ {
		bits[j] = (i >> uint(j)) & 1
	}
	return bits
}
```
