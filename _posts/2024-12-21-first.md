I was looking for a minimalist and easy way to create a personal website and blog. I found that GitHub Pages with Jekyll is a good option.

So today I set it up on my GitHub profile following [Creating a GitHub Pages site with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll). Another way to move the first steps with GitHub Pages is to follow the [GitHub Pages course](https://github.com/skills/github-pages). Some instructions are unclear or missing so I will try to fill the gaps here.

In short, here is how it works:

1. You create a new repository with the name `username.github.io` where `username` is your GitHub username.
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
1. Install and set up Jekyll

To add a new post, create a new file in the `_posts` directory with the name `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md` and write there your post in markdown format.

## Site and theme settings

The site and theme settings are in the `_config.yml` file.

### Enable skins

```diff
- theme: minima
+ remote_theme: jekyll/minima

+ minima:
+   skin: solarized
```

### Enable social icons

1. Take the `assets/minima-social-icons.liquid` file from [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) and push it to your repository `assets/` folder.

1. Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/jekyll/minima?tab=readme-ov-file#social-networks)

### Enable comments through Disqus

1. Create a Disqus site using [this form](https://disqus.com/admin/create/) and take note of the shortname (the unique Disqus URL prefix displayed under the _Website Name_ field).

1. Take the `_includes/disqus_comments.html` file from [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) and push it to your repository `_includes/` folder.

1. Make the following changes to your `_config.yml` file:

   ```diff
   - url: ""
   + url: https://myusername.github.io

   + disqus:
   +   shortname: my_disqus_shortname
   ```   

## Jekyll features

Among other things Jekyll offers support for code snippets:

{% highlight go %}
func IntToSliceOfBits(i, length int) []int {
	bits := make([]int, length)
	for j := 0; j < length; j++ {
		bits[j] = (i >> uint(j)) & 1
	}
	return bits
}
{% endhighlight %}

However they don't seem to look any different from the standard markdown code blocks:

```go
func IntToArrayOfBits(i, length int) []int {
	bits := make([]int, length)
	for j := 0; j < length; j++ {
		bits[j] = (i >> uint(j)) & 1
	}
	return bits
}
```
