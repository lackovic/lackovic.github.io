I was looking for a minimalist and easy way to create a personal website and blog. I found that GitHub Pages with Jekyll is a good option.

So today I set it up on my GitHub profile following [Creating a GitHub Pages site with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll). Another way to move the first steps with GitHub Pages is to follow the [GitHub Pages course](https://github.com/skills/github-pages).

In short, here is how it works:

1. You create a new repository with the name `username.github.io` where `username` is your GitHub username.
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
1. Install and set up Jekyll

To add a new post, create a new file in the `_posts` directory with the name `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md` and write there your post in markdown format.

To change the site settings and theme, edit the `_config.yml` file and push the changes to the repository.

Among other things Jekyll offers support for code snippets:

{% highlight go %}
func IntToSliceOfBits(i, length int) []int {
	bits := make([]int, length)
	for j := 0; j < length; j++ {
		bits[j] = (i >> uint(j)) & 1
	}
	return bits
}
{% endhighlight %}

However they don't seem any different from the standard markdown code blocks:

```go
func IntToArrayOfBits(i, length int) []int {
	bits := make([]int, length)
	for j := 0; j < length; j++ {
		bits[j] = (i >> uint(j)) & 1
	}
	return bits
}
```
